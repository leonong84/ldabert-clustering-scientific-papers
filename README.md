# ldabert-clustering-scientific-papers
This is a NLP project that aims to help researcher with finding relevant articles during systemic literature review process. The methodology proposed can be developed into a system that automatically group scientific publications to different categories without human annotatation or labeling. 
DBLP dataset v10 is used for training the model.

By Exploring 5 different clustering algorithms, the best clustering method was identified. Results and visualizations as well as detailed explanation are included.

Clustering algorithms:
- Centroid Based (regular kMeans)
- Spectral Clustering
- Distribution Based (DBSCAN)
- Grid Based
- LDA-BERT with kMeans
